# wifi_dash [![Build Status](https://drone.jonnrb.com/api/badges/jon/wifi_dash/status.svg?branch=master)](https://drone.jonnrb.com/jon/wifi_dash)

A small dashboard I use to look at who's on my Wi-Fi network.

I use [etcdhcp (forked)](https://github.com/JonNRb/etcdhcp) and
[hostapd_grpc](https://github.com/JonNRb/hostapd_grpc) to source backend
data.
